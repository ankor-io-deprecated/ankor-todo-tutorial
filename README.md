### Basic Setup

There is not really a standard way for developing web apps. 
In order to achieve a common tasks such as modularization we have settled with the following libraries for the purpose of this tutorial.

* For modularization we use [`require.js`][1].
* As already noted we use [`React`][2] for rendering views.
* To install the above libraries we have used [`bower`][3]. 

#### Project structure

All the work will be done in the `todo-servlet` module. 
As you may know from the other tutorials, the servlet module is simply a WebSocket endpoint of the `todo-server` application.
Since a Glassfish instance is running anyway we might as well use it to serve the static webapp files.

#### Purpose of the React pre-compiler

The jsx pre-compiler makes writing React components more convenient. 
It will compile components that look like this (note the inline `<div>` tag)

    :::js
    /** @jsx React.DOM */
    var HelloMessage = React.createClass({
      render: function() {
        return <div>Hello {this.props.name}</div>;
      }
    });
    
into valid JavaScript like this:

    :::js
    /** @jsx React.DOM */
    var HelloMessage = React.createClass({displayName: 'HelloMessage',
      render: function() {
        return React.DOM.div(null, "Hello ", this.props.name);
      }
    });
    
The later will be used by React internally to run it's "diff magic" and to update the DOM.
    
#### Starting the React pre-compiler

Inside the `js` folder are two sub folders called `src` and `build`. 
We will only change `.jsx` files in the `src` folder. 
These files will then be automatically compiled and placed in the `build` folder.

To start the pre-compiler run `./jsx.sh` in the `js` folder. 
It will watch for file changes of `.jsx` files in `src`.
Make sure that you followed the instructions form the previous step so that you have the `react-tools` installed.

#### main.jsx

The prototypical `main.jsx` file should look like this:
    
    :::js
    /**
     * @jsx React.DOM
     */
    define([
      "ankor/AnkorSystem",
      "ankor/transport/WebSocketTransport",
      "ankor/utils/BaseUtils",
      "react"
    ], function (AnkorSystem, WebSocketTransport, BaseUtils, React) {
      // TODO
    });
    
##### Purpose of the comment
The comment at the top indicated that this file needs to be passed through the React pre-compiler.
    
##### Structure of a require.js module
A require.js module starts with a call to `define` and lists a number of dependencies (without the `.js` at the end).
When all dependencies are loaded they are passed as arguments to a callback function. 
This allows the application developer to give names to each of them.

In `index.html` you can see this module being loaded:

    :::js
    require(["build/main"]);
    
As you can see it references the compiled file in the `build` folder, so again make sure the React pre-compiler works properly.
